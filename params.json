{"name":"NIRA","tagline":"NIRA solves solve coupled-constraint games.","body":"NIRA solves coupled-constraint games. It implements an equilibrium search method based on the Nikaido-Isoda function and a relaxation algorithm, hence the acronym NIRA. This version of NIRA includes a graphical user interface which allows the user to specify the game symbolically.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\nThe latest version is [1.1] (https://github.com/wilbur-t/nira/releases/tag/1.1). Earlier versions were developed before NIRA was migrated to GitHub, they are available [here] (https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B39JLTTdR-V8c0hSdUNVVmprM2M&usp=drive_web).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nNIRA runs through MATLAB, and makes use of the Optimization and Symbolic Math toolboxes. It is tested on MATLAB 2013b.\r\n\r\n## Manual\r\n\r\nThe NIRA manual is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx37Z6Mlfz5QRHp0TDc0Qzhsekk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nThe authors gratefully thank Victoria University of Wellington for support in creation and maintenance.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n### Jacek B.
