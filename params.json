It implements an equilibrium search method based on the Nikaido-Isoda function and a relaxation algorithm, hence the acronym NIRA. This version of NIRA includes a graphical user interface which allows the user to specify the game symbolically.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nNIRA-GUI runs through MATLAB, and makes use of the Optimization and Symbolic Math toolboxes. It is tested on MATLAB 2013b.\r\n\r\n## Manual\r\n\r\nThe NIRA-GUI manual is available here.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n# Jacek B.
